                <p style="text-align: center">
                    In the field of data science, understanding the drivers of salary disparities is crucial. In this analysis, we will investigate the influence of various factors on data science salaries, including company size, expertise level, employment type, company location, and changes over time. By examining these variables, 
                    we seek to gain insights into the intricacies of data science compensation.

                <p>The charts shown above provide insights into the world of data science employment. Most data science professionals work in <strong>medium-sized companies</strong>, indicating that it can be <strong>tough</strong> to land a data science role in <strong>larger firms</strong>. <br>Additionally, a significant number of these professionals have <strong>senior-level positions</strong>, 
                    but <strong>director-level roles</strong> are relatively rare, showcasing the difficulties in reaching top leadership positions in the field. These trends shed light on the <strong>complexities of data science career trajectories</strong>, emphasizing the <strong>attractiveness of mid-sized companies</strong> and the challenges of <strong>climbing to the highest levels</strong> in this profession.

                <p>
                    From the map above, it's evident that data science professionals in <strong>developed countries</strong> like the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan consistently receive high average salaries, exceeding $100,000 USD over the years. This indicates that these nations indeed offer lucrative compensation for this occupation. 
                    <br>However, upon closer examination of the Middle East, we find that certain developing countries, such as Iraq and Iran, also provide substantial salaries for data science roles. Additionally, China, despite being a developing nation, offers competitive salaries in this field. Consequently, it's not accurate to conclude that working in a developed country invariably results in higher earnings. Instead, one must take into account the specific job role and the local cost of living as significant determining factors.

                    <p>Next, we'll delve into analyzing the salary growth trends. As depicted in the chart on the right-hand side, 
                        it's apparent that salaries have increased from 2022 to 2023 in most regions across the globe. However, notable exceptions to this upward trend are observed in Africa and South America.

                        Examining the chart, it's clear that the majority of jobs tend to offer higher salaries to those who work full-time. However, there are some roles, such as principal data scientists and financial data analysts, that command higher pay when they are based on contract work. These positions are relatively more challenging to attain, which is why many individuals opt for 
                        full-time employment as it provides a more dependable and stable income.
